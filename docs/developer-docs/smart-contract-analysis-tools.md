# Smart Contract Analysis Tools

The following contains a list of tools that can be used to analyze the security of smart contracts. Although these tools are very useful, it is still recommended to do a manual security audit by specialized firms. 

## Static Analysis

- [Ethlint](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Ethlint): Analyzes solidity code for style and security issues and fixes them.
- [Securify](https://github.com/eth-sri/securify2): Is a security scanner for smart contracts supported by the Ethereum Foundation and ChainSecurity.
- [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither): Is a Solidity static analysis framework which helps developers to find vulnerabilities and secure their smart contracts.

## Dynamic Analysis

- [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/): Is designed for fuzzing/property testing of smart contracts.
- [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril): Mythril is a security analysis tool for EVM bytecode. It detects security vulnerabilities in smart contracts built EVM-compatible blockchains such as eCredits.
