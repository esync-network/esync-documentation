# The eSync network merge

The change to a proof of stake consensus algorithm gives us many advantages above the previously used proof of authority algorithm, but apparently also needs a complete new node setup in order to support the underlying processes.
In order to provide you with an as smooth as possible transition, we've prepared a short guideline on how to migrate your node from the PoA to the PoS setup.
Basically, no matter, if you're already running a validator account or not,  you'll have to setup a new one in order to be able to continue validation in the eSync Netowrk.

:::warning

Please make sure you have access to all accounts that are having funds from your old validator, to make sure not to lose any rewards!

:::

If you are using the eCredits management script, there will be an option to do the merge in the latest updated version. If you choose to use that one, it fully guides you through the process of the migration and, apart from making sure to have access to your funds, you don't have to do anything else.

If you were manually managing your node, please refer to [node setup guide](/docs/validators/node_setup.md). This will guide you through the required steps needed to setup your new PoS validator node.
