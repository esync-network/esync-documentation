# Decentralized Governance

The eSync Network is built upon the robust Ethereum protocol, a well-established open source blockchain technology. Having been adopted and extended, this technology serves as an ideal foundation for cultivating a rapidly expanding ecosystem.

While decentralization is a pivotal attribute of blockchain, this technology offers additional advantages:

- Security: Hacking a decentralized system is a greater challenge due to the absence of a single point of failure.

- Resilience: Decentralized systems thrive independently, free from the need for a central entity to oversee or administer them, showcasing resilience and autonomy.

- Zero-Trust: Users place their trust solely in the technology rather than a central entity or organization, benefiting from openness, transparency, and auditability.

- Transparency: Every transaction on the blockchain is both verifiable and immutable, fostering heightened trust in the system.

Achieving sufficient decentralization in the eSync Network involves numerous independent participants running Nodes, verifying and synchronizing the blockchain. Determining the exact decentralization threshold and the number of nodes required is challenging. Additionally, the power of each participant must be considered to ensure system-wide consensus for any changes. The eSync Network employs innovative technological and organizational approaches to establish decentralized governance, preserving the system's resilience and integrity.
