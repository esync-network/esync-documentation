### V1 Token Distribution

The maximum total supply of ECS is limited to 63,000,000,000 units.

**Circulating Supply**

ECS's circulating supply, comprising 18% of the total tokens, is actively tradable on exchanges.
To distribute ECS, third-party exchanges like Blocktrade facilitate accessibility, ensuring a broader reach, particularly within the EU. These chosen exchanges must emphasize technological openness for seamless integration, promoting wider ECS adoption.

ECS is tradeable on exchanges like Blocktrade, Bit2Me and Bitrue.
