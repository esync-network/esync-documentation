Rocksolid also offers a secure and fully regulated investment opportunity, in partnership with Equito, a MiFID II regulated broker. Investors also get voting rights to shape corporate decisions and can choose to invest in traditional real estate holdings or explore green energy initiatives like solar power plants.
