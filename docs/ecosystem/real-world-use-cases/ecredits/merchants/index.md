:::caution

You must add a store to make your business visible on the map!

:::

### Step 1: Register your eCredits eWallet App Account

- Download the eCredits Wallet App from the [App Store or Google Play](https://link.ecredits.com/app/install)
- Open the app and click "Sign Up"
- Enter your email and password. Accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
- You'll receive a confirmation code via email. Enter this code in the app to complete the account creation process

**_IMPORTANT: DON’T FORGET THE SEED PHRASE!_**

The Seed Phrase is a 12-word security key in a specific order for the eWallet App. It’s generated during the initial registration process. If you didn't set up the Seed Phrase during registration, you can find and manage it in the "Settings" section of the app. Remember to store the Seed Phrase in a secure place, keeping it hidden and inaccessible to others. Sharing any part of the Seed Phrase or your PIN/password can lead to unauthorized access to your private keys and assets (ECS, ACT) in the eWallet App.
:::

### Step 2: Set Up your eCredits Business Account

- Visit [portal.ecredits.com](https://portal.ecredits.com)
- Provide your email address and set your password.
- Check your email for a confirmation code and enter it in the eCredits Wallet App.
- Choose the account type "Create Merchant profile" when prompted.
- Set up your business details. If you are a Cashback Partner, connect to your myWorld Account.
- Choose your Business Subscription and activate it in the "Subscriptions" tab.

Congratulations! You are now an eCredits Merchant!

#### Business Subscription Plans

Depending on your or your business’ needs, you can choose a Basic Business Subscription or a Premium Business Subscription.
A _Premium Business Subscription_ is recommended if you have several stores you would like to accept eCredits (ECS) at with half the Transaction Cost of the Basic Business Subscription.

Additionally included in the Premium Business Subscription is the following:

- Multiple stores
- 0.5% Transaction Costs
- User Management System in the Web Portal
- eCredits Cashier App (running on smartphones, tablets and notebooks)
- Exclusive marketing tools, including the Deals functionality, which allows you to communicate special offers in the eWallet App to eCredits Users.
  The price of this Subscription Plan is €99 per year (excl. VAT). The Premium Business Subscription is a yearly subscription that has to be renewed at expiry.

A _Basic Business Subscription_ is best suited for Merchants with one store that are not looking for further functionalities that will accompany the ECS transactions and the exposure in the eWallet App map.
Included in the Premium Business Subscription is the following:

- One store
- 1% Transaction Costs
  This Subscription Plan is free of charge and is not limited in duration.

### Step 3: Exchange Authentication (optional)

Next, connect your eCredits account to your Blocktrade account. Blocktrade is a third-party exchange provider that provides several features, such as Instant Trade, in the eWallet App.

- Visit https://blocktrade.com/
- Click "Sign Up"
- Choose the option to create a "Business" account and select the legal type of your business.
- Complete the AML questionnaire and provide your personal information.
- Complete the KYC process and click "Submit company documents."
- You will receive an email from Blocktrade with instructions on what documents to provide.
- Send the requested files to Blocktrade for verification.
- Wait for their approval message or further instructions. The verification process may take up to two business days.

### Step 4: Accepting ECS and the Checkout Process

To request ECS at the point of sale, you can use either the eCredits Cashier App or your eWallet App.

If using the Cashier App:

- Enter the total amount of the purchase. Tap "Continue" to generate a QR code.
- Ask your customer to scan the QR code with their eCredits Wallet App.
- The customer can review the amount and confirm the transaction.
- You will receive confirmation of the successful transaction in your Cashier App.
  Both you and your customer will receive eActivity (ACT) rewards for the transaction. As a Merchant accepting ECS, you will receive a Transaction Bonus of 50% of the paid transaction fees in (ACT).
