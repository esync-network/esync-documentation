**_IMPORTANT: DON’T FORGET THE SEED PHRASE!_**

The Seed Phrase is a 12-word security key in a specific order for the eWallet App. It’s generated during the initial registration process. If you didn't set up the Seed Phrase during registration, you can find and manage it in the "Settings" section of the app. Remember to store the Seed Phrase in a secure place, keeping it hidden and inaccessible to others. Sharing any part of the Seed Phrase or your PIN/password can lead to unauthorized access to your private keys and assets (ECS, ACT) in the eCredits Wallet App.

### Step 2: Get eCredits (ECS)

There are three ways to acquire eCredits in your eCredits Wallet App:

- Buy on the connected exchange: Link your eCredits Wallet to an exchange and purchase eCredits (ECS) there. To transfer eCredits from the exchange to your eCredits Wallet, select the desired amount and click "Transfer."
- Use a public address: In the "eCredits Wallet" tab, click on the blue card or the "My Address" button to get your personal wallet address. Copy this address and use it as your public address to receive eCredits from any other source.
- Buy with credit/debit card or SEPA transaction: Go to the "Buy" tab of your eCredits Wallet App, choose your preferred provider and follow the instructions provided in the pop-up tabs.

### Step 3: Purchasing with eCredits

To get started, use the map in the eCredits Wallet App to locate eCredits Merchants. If you want to shop online, search for websites that accept ECS.
To purchase with ECS, simply scan the Merchant-generated QR code using the eCredits button in the eCredits Wallet App.
Every time you purchase with ECS, you earn eActivity (ACT) rewards. Also, when you shop at selected stores, you get eCashback. You can check your updated eActivity and eCashback balances any time.

## How to invite others?

Open your eCredits Wallet App and tap the “Settings” icon in the top right corner of the home screen.
Click the blue "Invite a friend" button below your profile image.
On the "Invite a friend" screen, you have two options:

- Enter the email address of the person you want to invite and click "Continue." An email invitation will be automatically sent to them.
- Generate a personal invitation link by tapping the “Create link” button at the bottom of the screen. Tap the generated link and share it through email, Messenger, WhatsApp, or any other supported channel.
  You will receive an eActivity Invite Bonus of 100 ACT in your eWallet once your friend accepts the invitation, downloads the eCredits Wallet App, and makes their first purchase on eCredits.
