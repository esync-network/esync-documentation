# eCredits Incentive Programs

eCredits comes with two integrated incentive programs: eActivity and eCashback.

## eActivity

eActivity is a decentralized reward system on the eSync Network that rewards active users with eActivity reward tokens (ACT) for specific activities like friend invitations or purchases.
ACTs are non-transferable and only for active supporters of the eCredits Ecosystem.

Types of eActivity Rewards:

- Purchase Bonus: Whenever a Consumer uses eCredits for purchases from eCredits Merchants, they receive 1% of the transaction amount in ACT.
- Invite Bonus: All Users are rewarded for inviting others to join eCredits
  - 300 ACT bonus is awarded once the invited Merchant has paid their Subscription
  - 100 ACT bonus is awarded once the invited User makes their first purchase with ECS
- Welcome Bonus: ACT is earned when joining The Peopleâ€™s SCE as a Member

## eCashback

eCashback is an optional Cashback program from a third-party Cashback provider.
To use it, ensure your eWallet App is connected to your third-party Cashback account. Green position markers on the eWallet App's map indicate eCashback partner acceptance points.

Benefits of eCashback:

- Completely free and set up in minutes
