The decision aligns with the core objective of rapidly decentralizing the eSync Network, mitigating single-point-of-failure risks, and solidifying trust in the ecosystem.","sidebar":"ecosystem"},"ecosystem/technical-discussion/decentralized-governance":{"id":"ecosystem/technical-discussion/decentralized-governance","title":"Decentralized Governance","description":"The eSync Network is built upon the robust Ethereum protocol, a well-established open source blockchain technology.

These node operators implement the PoS consensus method by verifying transactions and keeping the ledger up to date across the network. This is also important for the governance of the eSync Network.","sidebar":"ecosystem"},"ecosystem/tokenomics/index":{"id":"ecosystem/tokenomics/index","title":"Tokenomics","description":"Tokenomics V1","sidebar":"ecosystem"},"ecosystem/tokenomics/projects-treasury-allocations":{"id":"ecosystem/tokenomics/projects-treasury-allocations","title":"Project\u2019s Treasury Allocations","description":"chart.jpg","sidebar":"ecosystem"},"ecosystem/tokenomics/the-burn":{"id":"ecosystem/tokenomics/the-burn","title":"The Burn","description":"With the ongoing evolution of the chain, the original tokenomics was restructured, affecting how tokens are minted, distributed, and, most importantly, burned.","sidebar":"ecosystem"},"tools/index":{"id":"tools/index","title":"Tools Overview","description":"The following section contains a list of tools available for the eSync Network ecosystem, including some apps and hardware wallets.","sidebar":"tools"},"tools/ledger-hardware-wallet":{"id":"tools/ledger-hardware-wallet","title":"Ledger Hardware Wallet","description":"There is currently no app available for Ledger devices, but you can use the Ethereum app with Metamask to connect","sidebar":"tools"},"tools/metamask":{"id":"tools/metamask","title":"Metamask","description":"Metamask","sidebar":"tools"},"tools/trezor-hardware-wallet":{"id":"tools/trezor-hardware-wallet","title":"Trezor Hardware Wallet","description":"There is currently no native account support for trezor devices, but you can use Metamask to connect","sidebar":"tools"},"validators/faq":{"id":"validators/faq","title":"FAQ","description":"To which wallet will my rewards go?","sidebar":"validators"},"validators/index":{"id":"validators/index","title":"Validators","description":"In the eSync Network, validators serve a critical role in ensuring the security, consensus, and integrity of the network.","sidebar":"validators"},"validators/log_messages":{"id":"validators/log_messages","title":"Log Messages","description":"This section describes some of the log messages of the validator and what they mean:","sidebar":"validators"},"validators/node_maintenance":{"id":"validators/node_maintenance","title":"Operation and Maintenance","description":"Once your Validator Node is up and running, it\'s important to keep it that way.
